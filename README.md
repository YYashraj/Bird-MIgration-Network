# Bird-Migration-Network

- Utilized network science methodologies on real-world movement data to analyze Swainson's Hawk migratory patterns, gaining insights and identifying vulnerable geolocations to optimize preservation efforts.
- Developed an innovative approach to transform migratory trails into a weighted network, employing network statistical measures and community detection, validating the networkâ€™s alignment with actual habitat distinctions.
- Designed a pioneering network reconstruction technique, a variation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm with a custom-trained cost function using Ridge Regression, to pinpoint regions that could lead to migratory network failure.
